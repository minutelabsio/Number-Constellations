Brady Haran (of [Numberphile][numph]) came to us with an idea of laying out numbers on a grid and highlighting them based on the "family" they belonged to. His video on the [Prime Spirals][vid] sparked our curiosity and we decided we could take the idea a bit further...

Did you find anything interesting? See a mistake? Let us know what you think in the comments.
